  abstract = {The value of tax shields is the difference between the present values
	of two different cash flows, each with their own risk: the present
	value of taxes for the unlevered company and the present value of
	taxes for the levered company. For constant growth companies, the
	value of tax shields in a world with no leverage cost is the present
	value of the debt, times the tax rate, times the unlevered cost of
	equity, discounted at the unlevered cost of equity. This result arises
	as the difference of two present values and does not mean that the
	appropriate discount for tax shields is the unlevered cost of equity.},
